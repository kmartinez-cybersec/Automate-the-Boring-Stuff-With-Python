This is a small showcase of my answers to the practice problems in "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" by Al Sweigart, organized by chapter. I don't recommend copying my answers as I consider myself a beginner (at time of writing) and likely use not-so-good coding practices.
Although I have knowledge beyond the book, I try to use only the information taught in and up to each chapter the problems appear in. For example, you may see a _lot_ of `if` statements where other functions would be better suited for the problem at hand, 
but due to the book not teaching those functions yet, I'm stuck using those `if` statements.

If you're trying to find answers for the book and happen to stumble across this repository, again, I do **not** recommend copying these answers. I do, however, recommend using my answers to get some inspiration, or comparing your answers to mine to either improve your own code or criticize mine.
